        okay as i am ignoring my college application responsibilities for the moment, i have time to write a real diary entry. yay! gonna try and use more kaomoji bc tbh importing the animal crossing
        emojis as i wrote was tedious and idk if i want to bring that back as my main system. i totally will for my animal crossing shrine but otherwise it's on the fence...

        we did a t-shirt painting event for seniors today and it was more fun than expected tbh. i did get fabric paint on my polo so that shit is NOT coming out lmao (ÔæüœâÔæüÔºõ) also i won a core value
        for
        kindness today. on one hand i do try my best to be very kind to everyone but on the other hand it's kind of silly to recieve the weekly title for it in front of the whole school. right before
        they announced the awards, i had thought to myself "they're not going to give them to seniors because we won't be at the morning meetings" and tuned out and then they announced my name T-T so
        i kinda just looked shocked while everyone else clapped... a bit embarrasing ‡≤†_‡≤†
      </p>

      <p>
        as a whole, school is going okay so far. second week of senior year and we've done nothing more than sit through meetings in the auditorium all day (which feels <i>terrible</i> btw, tbh i'd
        rather sit in the classroom without the cushioned chairs so i can at least move around some...) so workload-wise it's not bad.
      </p>

        college is a whole other subject though. i wouldn't say i want to go to college (because who dreams of work after all) but i need to make money and i need a degree to do that in cyber stuff.
        so off to college i go. applications are so annoying cause they ask me questions like i'm gonna get married to someone. <b>why do you need to know all this man!!!</b> (i do know why but the
        application process is so tedious, and i'm onlt doing common app rn) plus i am so cooked in the funds
        department :'D i'm certainly lucky to be where i am now bc i know i'm very well off thanks to my parents jobs, but i pretty much fall into the "parents make enough money to not qualify for
        fafsa but not enough to put three kids through college back to back" category. honestly, even if it was just me going to college i think the costs are most of a yearly income so it's still not
        really achievable. my test scores and grades should get me decent scholarships, but if i were to get into MIT or something i am <i>so done for</i>. last i checked that was ~70k USD a year and
        i don't even have an act score in their average range. everyone there is at a 35-36 and i'm at a 31 „ÉΩ(Ôæü–îÔæü)Ôæâ realistically i know that my score is fine and i can get into most schools i want to
        but tbh i can't help feeling a little dumb. plus a sizable amount of my friends made higher on their first take of the act <i><u>without even studying</u></i> and that's the result i get after
        7+
        takes of the act. frustrating stuff!! <i>if only i was better at math... (;_;)</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        ignoring depressing college stuff, i can say that while i don't dream of work i <i>do</i> dream of my <u>perfect apartment life!!</u> of course i would rather have a house but in this economy?
        that shit is NOT looking promising lol. i do have dreams of great success and love and life and hopefully i can achieve them because if i don't that will cause some other problems (ÔæüœâÔæüÔºõ) if
        i'm being completely honest, my ideal life probably looks a lot like what's displayed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@annikasleaf">annika's vlog series</a> which i've been super into ever
        since i stumbled upon vlogging videos freshman year. i don't think i've really been into keeping up with a youtuber before her tbh, her videos just feel so calming to watch and even though
        many things are idealized online she does show everyday mishaps that make her videos just that much more entertaining and inspiring to watch lol. vlogs and baking videos have become a big part
        of my weekly routine because they're so calming and give me something to look forward to
        creating for my future! Ôºà*Ôºæ„ÉØÔºæ*Ôºâ honestly, if i was able to keep a nice apartment with someone i loved and work a job i didn't hate but still make enough to live comfortably off of with decent
        vacation options and things like that, i'd be set. <b>for some reason that feels like asking for a lot though... ÔºàÍê¶ùÖí_ùÖíÔºâ</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        might start making writing here a part of my nightly routine so i have at least some archive of my thoughts? but for now i need to get ready for bed so adios :)
